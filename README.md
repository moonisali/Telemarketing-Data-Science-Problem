# Telemarketing-Data-Science-Project
This project relates to the marketing campaign of Banco de Portugal, a renowned Portuguese banking institution. It provides a solution in terms of YES/NO prediction to the bankâ€™s marketing division, to sell long-term (fixed) deposits to clients based on various parameters such as their socio-economic indicators, their marital status, type of job, age, etc. The aim of the project is to make use of machine learning techniques to build an effective predictive-analytical model which can forecast, whether a client is likely to subscribe to a long-term (fixed) deposit account with the bank or not. Since the resulting variable (outcome) is either a Yes or No and more than two variables are used as input to make the prediction, the problem attains the shape of a multivariate binary classification problem.
